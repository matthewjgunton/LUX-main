Lehigh-University-eXchange

LUX is an iOS exclusive, with a Node.JS background


The app serves two purposes:
* help students of Lehigh University find events they normally would not hear about
    * this is done through a user-friendly and seamless design scheme that makes it easy for users to
    see many different events at once, and choose the ones they are interested in
    * a major consideration in showing events, are ones that the user's facebook friends are going to
    * the user can also say which types of events they are interested in:
      social (events like meet & greets or frat parties are potential ones here)
      formal (events you need to apply for, or are more structured, good example is zoellner)

* sort students going into groups when they need a group to do go with
    sort students based on which dorms they live in,
    grade-level
    likes on facebook
      *when groups are big enough, we can take into account everything facebook gives us
